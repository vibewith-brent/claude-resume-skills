# STAR Expansion Templates

Templates for expanding weak resume bullets into strong STAR-format achievements.

## The STAR Framework

- **S**ituation — Context or challenge faced
- **T**ask — Your specific responsibility
- **A**ction — What you did (specific steps)
- **R**esult — Measurable outcome or impact

## Templates by Achievement Type

---

### Performance Optimization

**Weak:** "Made the system faster"

**STAR Template:**
```
Situation: [System] was experiencing [latency/performance issues] affecting [users/operations]

**Weak:** "Managed a team"

**STAR Template:**
```
Situation: Team of [X] needed [growth/improvement/new capability]

**STAR Template:**
```
Situation: [Project] was needed to [business goal] with [constraints/timeline]
Task: Lead/contribute to delivering the project successfully
Action: [Designed architecture, coordinated teams, managed stakeholders]
Result: Delivered [project] [on time/early], achieving [business outcome]
```

"Led cross-functional team of 6 to deliver customer-facing mobile app in 4 months, coordinating between product, design, and backend teams, launching to 50K users with 4.7 App Store rating"

---

### Innovation / New Capability

**Weak:** "Created new feature"

**STAR Template:**
```
Situation: [Business/users] needed [capability] that didn't exist
Task: Design and implement solution to address the need
Action: [Researched, prototyped, built, iterated]
Result: Launched [feature] adopted by [X users/teams], enabling [outcome]
```

**Example:**
"Designed and built real-time fraud detection system using ML ensemble models, processing 10K transactions/second with 99.2% accuracy, preventing estimated $8M in annual fraud losses"

## Quick Transformation Patterns

| Weak Phrase | Stronger Pattern |
|-------------|------------------|
| "Responsible for..." | "Owned/Led/Delivered..." |
| "Worked on..." | "Built/Designed/Implemented..." |
| "Helped with..." | "Contributed to [X] by [specific action]..." |
| "Participated in..." | "Collaborated with [team] to deliver..." |
| "Assisted..." | "Enabled [outcome] by [action]..." |
| "Was involved in..." | "Drove [initiative], resulting in..." |

## Adding Metrics

When exact numbers aren't available:

- **Estimates**: "~500K users", "approximately 30% improvement"
- **Comparisons**: "3x faster than previous approach"
- **Scale descriptors**: "across 15 microservices", "serving 50K DAU"
- **Time frames**: "within 3 months", "ahead of 6-month deadline"
- **Team size**: "leading team of 8", "coordinating with 5 departments"
