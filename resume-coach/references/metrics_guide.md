# How to Estimate Missing Metrics

When users say "I don't have the exact numbers," use these techniques to help them estimate or express impact.

## Why Metrics Matter

Recruiters and hiring managers scan for numbers. Bullets with metrics are:
- More credible (specific > vague)
- More memorable (numbers stick)
- Easier to compare (quantifiable value)

**Goal:** Every bullet should have at least one number or quantifiable element.

## Estimation Techniques

### 1. Order of Magnitude

If you don't know the exact number, estimate the range:

| Instead of... | Say... |
|---------------|--------|
| "many users" | "~10K users" or "thousands of users" |
| "large dataset" | "50M+ records" or "terabytes of data" |
| "significant savings" | "~$500K annually" or "6-figure savings" |

**Prompt:** "Even if you don't know exactly, was it hundreds, thousands, or millions?"

### 2. Before/After Comparisons

When you can't quantify the absolute value, describe the change:

| Instead of... | Say... |
|---------------|--------|
| "improved performance" | "3x faster than previous system" |
| "reduced errors" | "cut error rate in half" |
| "increased adoption" | "doubled weekly active users" |

**Prompt:** "What was it like before vs. after? Even a rough comparison helps."

### 3. Percentage Improvements

Convert absolute changes to percentages:

| Scenario | Calculation | Result |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Latency: 500ms → 100ms | (500-100)/500 | "80% reduction" |
| Users: 10K → 25K | (25-10)/10 | "150% growth" |
| Errors: 50/day → 10/day | (50-10)/50 | "80% fewer errors" |

**Prompt:** "If you had to guess, what percentage improvement would you estimate?"

### 4. Time Frames

Add temporal context to make impact concrete:

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "saved time" | "saved 10 hours/week" |
| "delivered quickly" | "delivered in 3 months" |
| "ongoing impact" | "sustained for 2+ years" |

**Prompt:** "How often did this happen? How long did the impact last?"

### 5. Scale Descriptors

When numbers aren't available, describe scope:

- **Team size:** "team of 8", "cross-functional group of 15"
- **System scope:** "across 12 microservices", "spanning 3 data centers"
- **User segments:** "enterprise clients", "Fortune 500 customers"
- **Geography:** "global rollout", "15 countries"

**Prompt:** "How big was the team, system, or user base involved?"

## Common Metric Categories

### Time / Speed
- Response time (ms, seconds)
- Processing time (hours, days)
- Time to market (weeks, months)
- Time saved per week/month

### Money / Revenue
- Cost savings ($/year)
- Revenue generated
- Budget managed
- ROI percentage

### Volume / Scale
- Users (DAU, MAU, total)
- Transactions per second/day
- Data processed (GB, TB, records)
- Requests handled

### Quality / Reliability
- Uptime percentage (99.9%)
- Error rate (%)
- Customer satisfaction (NPS, CSAT)
- Defect reduction (%)

### Efficiency / Productivity
- Automation percentage
- Manual hours eliminated
- Process steps reduced
- Throughput increase

### People / Growth
- Team size built
- People hired/mentored
- Adoption rate
- Retention improvement

## Estimation Validation Questions

After estimating, validate with these checks:

1. **Would your manager agree?**
   "If I showed this number to your manager, would they nod or push back?"

2. **Is there a data source?**
   "Was this tracked anywhere? Dashboards, reports, emails celebrating the win?"

3. **Conservative enough?**
   "Is this the conservative estimate? Better to understate than overstate."

4. **Believable range?**
   "Does this pass the sniff test for someone in the industry?"

## When Exact Numbers Aren't Possible

Sometimes metrics genuinely don't exist. Alternatives:

### Use Qualitative Impact
- "Only engineer trusted to handle critical production systems"
- "Go-to person for complex customer escalations"
- "Selected to lead highest-priority company initiative"

### Use Social Proof
- "Work recognized with [award/promotion/mention]"
- "Approach adopted as team standard"
- "Invited to present at [conference/all-hands]"

### Use Contrast
- "First to achieve [outcome] in company history"
- "Completed in half the typical timeline"
- "Handled workload of 3 previous contractors"

## Red Flags to Avoid

| Don't Write | Problem |
|-------------|---------|
| "Improved metrics significantly" | No actual number |
| "Saved the company money" | How much? |
| "Led a successful project" | Success measured how? |
| "Worked with large datasets" | How large? |
| "Improved customer experience" | By what measure? |

## Quick Estimation Prompts

Use these to quickly surface numbers:

1. "How many [users/transactions/records]?"
2. "What was the before and after?"
3. "How much time/money did this save?"
4. "How many people were involved or affected?"
5. "What percentage improvement would you estimate?"
6. "How long did this take or how long has it lasted?"
7. "If you had to put a dollar value on this, what would it be?"
