# Guidelines for creating quality YAML resumes:
#
# 1. Use consistent date formats throughout (e.g., "Jan 2020 - Present", "2018 - 2020", "Mar 2021 - Dec 2022")
# 2. Start all achievement bullets with strong action verbs
# 3. Include metrics and quantifiable results where possible
# 4. Keep achievements concise (1-2 lines each)
# 5. Order experience reverse-chronologically (most recent first)
# 6. Use proper YAML syntax:
#    - Use quotes for strings containing special characters (: , [ ] { } & * # ? | - < > = ! % @ \)
#    - Use | for multi-line strings (like summary)
#    - Use consistent indentation (2 spaces recommended)
# 7. Include only sections relevant to your experience
# 8. Omit optional fields that don't apply
