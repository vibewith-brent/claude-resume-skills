# Visual QA Checklist for Resume PDFs

Systematic evaluation criteria for compiled resume PDFs. Check each category and note any failures.

---

## 1. Page Layout & Overflow

### Critical Checks
- [ ] Content fits within expected page count (typically 1-2 pages)
- [ ] No text cut off at page edges
- [ ] No content overflowing into margins
- [ ] No blank pages at end (unless intentional)

### Page Break Issues
- [ ] No orphaned section headers (header at page bottom, content on next page)
- [ ] No widows (single line of a paragraph at page top)
- [ ] No section split awkwardly across pages
- [ ] Page breaks occur at logical points (between jobs, not mid-bullet)

---

## 2. Typography & Readability

### Font Hierarchy
- [ ] Name is most prominent element (largest, possibly bold)
- [ ] Section headers clearly distinguished from body text
- [ ] Job titles distinguishable from company names
- [ ] Body text is consistent size throughout

### Size & Spacing
- [ ] Body text is readable (minimum ~10pt equivalent)
- [ ] Line spacing aids readability (not cramped)
- [ ] Paragraph spacing separates distinct items
- [ ] No text so small it strains readability

### Font Consistency
- [ ] Same font family used consistently for same element types
- [ ] Bold/italic used purposefully, not randomly
- [ ] No unexpected font switches mid-section
- [ ] Special characters render correctly (bullets, dashes, quotes)

---

## 3. Whitespace & Visual Balance

### Margins
- [ ] Margins are consistent on all sides
- [ ] Margins are appropriate (not too tight, not excessive)
- [ ] Content doesn't crowd the edges
- [ ] Margin size matches template style (modern=generous, dense=tighter)

### Section Spacing
- [ ] Consistent gaps between major sections
- [ ] Spacing distinguishes sections without wasting space
- [ ] No random large gaps mid-page
- [ ] Visual rhythm is maintained throughout

### Internal Spacing
- [ ] Bullet points have consistent indentation
- [ ] Space between bullets is even
- [ ] Company/role blocks have internal consistency
- [ ] Skills categories evenly spaced

### Visual Weight Distribution
- [ ] Content doesn't cluster to one area
- [ ] Top-heavy or bottom-heavy appearance avoided
- [ ] Two-column layouts have balanced columns
- [ ] No "floating" elements with too much surrounding space

---

## 4. Alignment & Structure

### Horizontal Alignment
- [ ] Dates aligned consistently (all right-aligned, or all inline)
- [ ] Section headers aligned consistently
- [ ] Bullet points start at same indent level
- [ ] Company names/titles aligned consistently

### Vertical Alignment
- [ ] Multi-column content aligns at top
- [ ] Sidebar content (if any) aligns with main content
- [ ] No jagged vertical edges in text blocks

### Structural Consistency
- [ ] Same pattern used for all job entries
- [ ] Same pattern used for all education entries
- [ ] Skills section has consistent structure throughout
- [ ] Contact info layout is clean and logical

---

## 5. Color & Contrast

### Readability
- [ ] Text has sufficient contrast against background
- [ ] Light text on dark backgrounds is readable
- [ ] Colored text is not too light to read
- [ ] Links/accents don't clash with main text

### Color Usage
- [ ] Color palette is cohesive (2-3 colors max)
- [ ] Color used consistently (all headers same color, etc.)
- [ ] Accent color draws attention to right elements
- [ ] Not overwhelming or distracting

### Print Considerations
- [ ] Would print acceptably in black and white
- [ ] No critical info conveyed only by color
- [ ] Colored backgrounds don't waste ink

---

## 6. Content-Specific Checks

### Contact Section
- [ ] Name is immediately visible and prominent
- [ ] Contact methods are clear and accessible
- [ ] Links are distinguishable (if applicable)
- [ ] No visual clutter

### Experience Section
- [ ] Job progression is clear (most recent first)
- [ ] Each role is visually distinct
- [ ] Achievements are easy to scan (bullet format)
- [ ] Company/title/date relationship is clear

### Skills Section
- [ ] Skills are easy to scan quickly
- [ ] Categories (if used) are visually distinct
- [ ] Not cramped or hard to parse
- [ ] Format matches resume density (list vs. inline vs. table)

### Education Section
- [ ] Institution names are prominent
- [ ] Degree info is clear
- [ ] Dates are visible but not dominant
- [ ] Additional details (GPA, honors) appropriately sized

---

## 7. ATS & Technical Compatibility

### Text Extraction
- [ ] All text is selectable (not rendered as images)
- [ ] Copy-paste produces readable text
- [ ] No garbled characters when text is extracted
- [ ] Section headers use standard terms (Experience, Education, Skills)

### Structure
- [ ] Simple, parseable layout (avoid complex tables)
- [ ] Reading order is logical when extracted
- [ ] No hidden text or layers
- [ ] Standard PDF format (not scanned image)

## Scoring Guide

For each category, assign:
- **PASS**: All critical checks pass, minor issues acceptable
- **WARN**: Some issues that should be addressed
- **FAIL**: Critical issues that must be fixed

### Overall Assessment
- **READY**: All PASS, ready to submit
- **NEEDS WORK**: Has WARN items, review recommended
- **REVISE**: Has FAIL items, must fix before use

## Quick Reference: Most Common Issues

1. **Content overflow** — Too much text for page, bullets cut off
2. **Inconsistent spacing** — Gaps vary between sections
3. **Date misalignment** — Dates don't line up on right side
4. **Font size too small** — Cramped to fit content
5. **Orphaned headers** — Section title alone at page bottom
6. **Unbalanced whitespace** — Dense top, empty bottom (or vice versa)
7. **Color contrast** — Light gray text hard to read
8. **Broken special characters** — Bullets or dashes render incorrectly
