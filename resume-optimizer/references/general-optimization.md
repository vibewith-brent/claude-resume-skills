## Content Quality Review

### Experience Bullets Checklist

For each experience bullet:
- [ ] Starts with strong action verb (not "Helped", "Worked on", "Responsible for")
- [ ] Includes what you did AND how you did it
- [ ] Contains at least one metric or quantifiable result
- [ ] Is specific (not vague like "improved system performance")
- [ ] Is concise (1-2 lines maximum)
- [ ] Demonstrates impact (not just activities)

### Professional Summary Checklist

- [ ] 2-4 sentences (not a paragraph)
- [ ] Highlights years of experience and seniority level
- [ ] Mentions 3-5 core competencies/specializations
- [ ] Includes industry/domain context
- [ ] Demonstrates value proposition

### Skills Section Checklist

- [ ] Organized by logical categories
- [ ] Most important/relevant skills listed first
- [ ] Proficiency levels indicated if helpful
- [ ] No outdated or irrelevant technologies
- [ ] Specific (not "Programming" but "Python, Java, Go")

## Common Issues to Fix

### Issue: Weak Action Verbs

Replace passive or weak verbs with strong action verbs:

- "Helped" → "Enabled", "Facilitated"
- "Worked on" → "Developed", "Built", "Implemented"
- "Responsible for" → "Owned", "Managed", "Led"
- "Participated in" → "Contributed to", "Collaborated on"
- "Involved in" → "Executed", "Delivered"
- "Assisted with" → "Supported", "Enabled"

See `action_verbs.yaml` for comprehensive list categorized by impact type.

### Issue: Missing Metrics

For each bullet, attempt to add at least one metric from these categories:

**Time/Speed:**
- Reduced X from [time] to [time]
- Improved X by [X]%
- Saved [X] hours per [period]

**Cost/Revenue:**
- Saved $X annually
- Generated $X in revenue
- Reduced costs by X%

**Scale/Volume:**
- Processed X items per [period]
- Scaled to handle X requests
- Served X users/customers

**Quality/Accuracy:**
- Improved accuracy from X% to Y%
- Reduced error rate by X%
- Achieved X% [metric]

**Team/Adoption:**
- Led team of X
- Adopted by X teams
- Onboarded X users

**Efficiency:**
- Automated X% of process
- Eliminated X hours of manual work
- Reduced manual effort by X%

### Finding Metrics When You Don't Have Exact Numbers

If you don't have exact metrics, use these strategies:

1. **Estimate based on scope:** "~500K users", "10M+ requests"
2. **Compare to baseline:** "3x faster than previous approach"
3. **Describe scale:** "across 15+ microservices"
4. **Use qualitative impact:** "became standard platform across organization"
5. **Before/after comparison:** "from manual to automated"
6. **Frequency:** "daily", "real-time", "on-demand"

### Issue: Vague Language

**Vague → Specific transformations:**

❌ "Improved system performance"
✅ "Reduced API response time from 800ms to 120ms"

❌ "Worked with stakeholders"
✅ "Collaborated with Product, Engineering, and Compliance teams"

❌ "Built data pipeline"
✅ "Built PySpark ETL pipeline processing 50M+ daily transactions"

❌ "Used machine learning techniques"
✅ "Developed GBM model using XGBoost and feature engineering"

❌ "Managed projects"
✅ "Led 3-month migration project across 5 microservices"

### Issue: Passive Voice

Transform passive constructions to active voice:

❌ "Was responsible for managing team"
✅ "Managed team of 4 data scientists"

❌ "Involved in developing models"
✅ "Developed credit underwriting models"

❌ "Tasks included building and deploying"
✅ "Built and deployed machine learning pipeline"

### Issue: Too Verbose

Cut unnecessary words while preserving meaning:

❌ "Successfully implemented and deployed"
✅ "Implemented and deployed" (success is implied)

❌ "In order to improve performance"
✅ "To improve performance"

❌ "Conducted an analysis of customer data"
✅ "Analyzed customer data"

❌ "Responsible for the management of"
✅ "Managed"

❌ "Utilize advanced techniques"
✅ "Use advanced techniques" or better: "Applied [specific technique]"

### Issue: Buzzwords Without Substance

Replace buzzwords with concrete details:

❌ "Leveraged cutting-edge AI technologies"
✅ "Implemented GPT-4 and LangChain for RAG pipeline"

❌ "Utilized robust data science methodologies"
✅ "Applied gradient boosting and feature engineering"

❌ "Delivered innovative solutions"
✅ "Developed automated triage system reducing response time by 40%"

❌ "Demonstrated thought leadership"
✅ "Presented quarterly model monitoring results to Senior Leadership"

## Resume Length Guidelines

### By Experience Level

- **Early career (0-5 years):** 1 page
- **Mid-career (5-10 years):** 1-2 pages
- **Senior/Staff (10+ years):** 2 pages
- **Executive:** 2-3 pages

### Bullets Per Role

- **Current role:** 4-6 bullets
- **Recent roles (last 5 years):** 3-5 bullets
- **Older roles (5-10 years ago):** 2-3 bullets
- **Very old roles (10+ years ago):** 1-2 bullets or consolidate

### Reducing Length

If resume is too long:

1. **Remove oldest roles:** Consolidate roles >10 years old
2. **Prioritize recent impact:** Keep strongest bullets from recent roles
3. **Remove redundancy:** Don't repeat similar achievements across roles
4. **Cut skills section:** Remove outdated or basic skills
5. **Shorten summary:** Aim for 2-3 sentences max
6. **Reduce education details:** For experienced professionals, just degree + year

## Section-Specific Guidelines

### Professional Summary

**Formula:**
[Title/Level] + [Years Experience] + [Specializations] + [Industries] + [Key Value Proposition]

**Example:**

Experienced in architecting agentic workflows, RAG, multi-agent orchestration, and LLM CI/CD. Proven record integrating LLMs with multi-cloud data platforms to automate support, security, and credit-risk systems.

### Experience Section

**Title formatting:**
Company Name — Dates
*Job Title — Specialty/Focus (if applicable)*

**Bullet structure:**
