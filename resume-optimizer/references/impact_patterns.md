## Finding Metrics When You Don't Have Them

### Strategy 1: Estimate Based on Scope

If you don't have exact metrics, make reasonable estimates based on:
- Number of users/customers impacted
- Size of data processed
- Frequency of usage
- Team size or stakeholder count

**Use qualifying language:**
- "~500K users" or "500K+ users"
- "Approximately 40% reduction"
- "10M+ daily requests"

### Strategy 2: Compare to Baseline

Describe improvement relative to previous state:
- Before/after comparisons
- Versus legacy system
- Compared to manual process
- Relative to industry baseline

### Strategy 3: Describe Scale Indirectly

If you can't quantify outcomes, quantify scope:
- Size of codebase touched
- Number of services integrated
- Complexity of system
- Duration or timeline

**Example:**
- Architected microservices platform integrating 15+ internal APIs across authentication, data access, and workflow orchestration

### Strategy 4: Use Qualitative Impact

When metrics aren't available, describe qualitative impact:
- First to implement X at company
- Became standard approach/platform
- Featured in company-wide demo
- Requested by leadership for replication
