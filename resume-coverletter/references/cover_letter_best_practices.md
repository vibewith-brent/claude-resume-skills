## Opening Strategies

### Strong Openings
- Lead with specific interest in company/role
- State relevant experience duration upfront
- Connect expertise directly to role needs
- Reference mutual connections or company initiatives (if applicable)

### Examples

**Good:**
> I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Data Engineer position at DataCorp. With 8+ years of building scalable data pipelines and leading cross-functional analytics teams, I bring proven expertise in transforming data infrastructure to drive business outcomes.

**Weak:**
> I am applying for the position advertised on your website. I believe I would be a good fit for this role.

### Avoid
- "I am writing to apply..." (obvious, weak opening)
- Generic enthusiasm without specifics
- Restating resume summary verbatim
- Long backstory before stating intent

## Achievement Highlighting

### Selection Criteria
- Choose 3-5 most relevant achievements from resume
- Prioritize metrics and quantifiable impact
- Select achievements that map to job requirements
- Balance technical skills with leadership/collaboration

### Formatting
- Use bullet points or paragraph format (match template)
- Lead with strong action verbs
- Include specific numbers, percentages, dollar amounts
- Show both what you did and the impact

### Examples

**Strong Achievement:**
> Architected real-time data pipeline processing 500M+ daily events, reducing latency by 75% and enabling product team to ship features 3x faster.

**Weak Achievement:**
> Worked on data pipelines and helped improve performance.

## Company Research Integration

### What to Research
- Company mission, values, recent news
- Industry challenges and trends
- Specific team/department initiatives
- Leadership perspectives (blog posts, interviews)
- Product/service differentiators

### How to Integrate
- Reference specific company initiatives or values
- Connect your experience to their challenges
- Show understanding of their market position
- Demonstrate cultural alignment
- Use industry-specific terminology naturally

### Examples

**Good:**

**Weak:**
> I like your company and think it would be a good place to work.
